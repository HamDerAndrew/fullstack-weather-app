# fullstack-weather-app
Feel free to clone the repo and mess around with it yourself.

# Installation
1. clone repo and run `npm install`

2. You're good to go. Start a dev server with `npm run start`

# API Keys
You'll need an API Key from Mapbox and WeatherStack.

You can either use mine or generate your own by going to each website and register a user.

I know this isn't something
you normally would share, but since this is just a personal hobby project
I don't mind :)

Add the API keys as the following environment variables and the project will run fine:

WEATHERSTACK_API_KEY='506dffb1bfa5251d1550b0dd5f7763fb'

MAPBOX_API_KEY = 'pk.eyJ1IjoiYWxhcnNlbiIsImEiOiJjazlsOWI4NWswMmZoM21tdGZvaWk5a3FvIn0.aBWh-pC7cINpuAhHp3_lYw'
